// Problem statement
// Programming languages have some conditional / decision-making statements that execute when some specific condition is fulfilled.
// Switch-case is one of the ways to implement them.
// In a menu-driven program, the user is given a set of choices of things to do (the menu) and then is asked to select a menu item.
// There are 2 choices in the menu:
// Choice 1 is to find the area of a circle having radius 'r'.
// Choice 2 is to find the area of a rectangle having dimensions 'l' and 'b'.
// You are given the choice 'ch' and an array 'a'.
// If ‘ch’ is 1, ‘a’ contains a single number ‘r’. If ‘ch’ is 2, ‘a’ contains 2 numbers, ‘l’ and ‘b’.
// Consider the choice and print the appropriate area.
// Example :
// Input: ‘ch’ = 2 and ‘a’ = [3, 2]
// Output: area = 6
// Explanation: Since the choice ‘ch’ is 2, we have to print the area of the rectangle having ‘l’ = 3 and ‘b’ = 2, which is 6.


double areaSwitchCase(int ch, vector<double> a) {
	// Write your code here

	switch(ch){
		case 1: 
		return 3.14159265359*a[0]*a[0];
		break;

		case 2: 
		return a[0]*a[1];
		break;

		default:
		return -1;
	}
}
